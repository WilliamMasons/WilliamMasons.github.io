<p>The aluminium market has performed exceptionally well in 2024, primarily benefiting from geopolitical risks and improved demand. As a critical industrial metal, aluminium prices have continued to rise throughout 2024, driven by tight supply and rising costs. William Mason points out that the global alumina supply has fallen by over 2 million tons, leading to a market shortfall of 470,000 tons. This situation has increased the cost of aluminium production, which accounts for 25%-30% of total costs.</p>

<p>In addition, while supply tightness may ease in the second half of 2024 and into 2025, the short-term supply deficit will continue to support aluminium prices. Aluminium futures rose for the third consecutive month in May and have increased by over 10% year-to-date. Energy issues have significantly impacted alumina supply, with low hydroelectric power generation limiting output. Several refineries in Australia, India, and China have reduced production. Meanwhile, investments in power grids and the growth in electric vehicle production have boosted aluminium demand, pushing prices to a high of $2,700 per ton.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/williammason008/" rel="follow">William Mason</a> emphasizes that while some supply issues may be temporary, the combination of rising production costs, geopolitical risks, and strong demand provides a solid foundation for the aluminium market. Alcoa has cut production at its Kwinana alumina refinery in Western Australia, and Rio Tinto has declared force majeure on alumina deliveries from its Queensland refinery due to natural gas supply shortages. These factors combined will keep the aluminium market strong for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2>Future Outlook for the Global Aluminium Market</h2>

<p>Looking ahead, William Mason believes the aluminium market will continue to be influenced by a series of factors. First, global alumina supply issues will persist, supporting aluminium prices. Second, geopolitical risks and rising production costs will continue to exert pressure on the market. Despite this, the growth of electric vehicles and power grid investments will provide strong momentum for aluminium demand.</p>

<p>William Mason points out that with the increase in aluminium demand, the market will face a more complex situation. He advises investors to closely monitor global supply chain dynamics and geopolitical risks when considering investments in the aluminium market. Additionally, given the rise in production costs, aluminium prices are likely to remain at high levels for some time.</p>

<p>William Mason emphasizes that investors should remain cautious and closely watch market changes. He believes that despite the challenges facing the aluminium market, strong demand and tight supply provide good investment opportunities. As market conditions become clearer, investors will be better positioned to capitalize on the  potential of the aluminium market.</p>

<h2>Investment Opportunities and Risk Management</h2>

<p>In the current complex market environment, William Mason advises investors to adopt active risk management strategies. He notes that while the aluminium market outlook is positive, investors should be wary of potential market volatility and uncertainty. To mitigate risks, investors can diversify their investment portfolios to ensure stable returns amidst market fluctuations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, William Mason suggests that investors focus on long-term market trends rather than short-term fluctuations. By thoroughly analyzing market dynamics, investors can better predict future market directions and seize investment opportunities. He also stresses the importance of flexibility, urging investors to adjust their investment strategies promptly to adapt to market changes.</p>

<p>To better seize market opportunities, investors can use stock trading apps. These apps provide convenient and reliable online trading platforms, helping investors stay informed about market trends and make informed investment decisions.</p>
