<h2>Analysis of the Iron Ore Market Outlook</h2>

<p>In the coming years, the iron ore market will face numerous challenges and opportunities. According to the latest forecast from the commodities strategy team of William Mason, iron ore prices are expected to decrease by 1% in 2024 and by 10% and 11% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. This is primarily due to the dual impact of stagnant demand growth and the growing long-term supply. On the demand side, the view of William Mason is that "structural demand growth is limited," meaning there will not be significant growth in iron ore demand. Meanwhile, the supply side presents conflicting short-term and long-term factors.</p>

<h2>In-depth Analysis of the Iron Ore Market</h2>

<p>William Mason notes that, in the short term, current iron ore prices have already reflected the extent of the oversupply expected in 2024. Therefore, the team of William Mason is tactically optimistic about the short-term performance of iron ore, forecasting prices to be $114 per tonne in 2024, about 10% higher than the current price of $103 per tonne and 2% above the general market expectation. This view is based on the current supply situation and stable short-term demand. However, this short-term optimism does not represent the long-term market trend.</p>

<p>In the long term, the iron ore market will face the risk of oversupply. The commencement of the Simandou project of Rio Tinto in West Africa and the Onslow project of Mineral Resources will significantly increase market supply, driving down iron ore prices. William Mason predicts these projects will cause iron ore prices in 2025-2027 to be 8%, 14%, and 11% lower than general expectations, respectively. They maintain their long-term forecast of $80 per tonne, about 10%-15% lower than general expectations.</p>

<p>On the demand side,William Mason points out that global economic growth slowing and limited structural growth in steel demand make it difficult for iron ore demand to rise significantly. This forecast is closely related to the overall performance of the global steel industry, particularly changes in demand in the Chinese market, which has a crucial impact on iron ore prices. As the economic growth of China slows, steel demand growth will also stabilize, further affecting the iron ore market.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the current complex market environment, investors need to cautiously navigate the volatility of the iron ore market. While iron ore prices may rise in the short term, long-term oversupply will pressure prices. Investors should adjust their asset allocations and diversify investment risks according to market changes. William Mason advises that investors can take advantage of short-term market fluctuations for tactical investments but should also prepare for long-term market adjustments.</p>
