<p>Recently, the situation in the Middle East has once again become a focus of international attention. In particular, the drone and missile attacks of Iran on Israel have not only escalated internal conflicts onto a broader international stage but also could significantly impact crude oil prices. Based on historical experience, such geopolitical tensions often lead to substantial fluctuations in energy markets. For instance, the early 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a sharp rise in global crude oil prices.</p>

<p>William Mason believes that investors should pay special attention to energy stocks in this environment, especially those oil companies with significant assets in the Middle East. While such stocks may benefit from rising oil prices, it is also crucial to consider the increased geopolitical risks. This uncertainty could lead to drastic stock price fluctuations, so investors should fully factor in these risks in their investment decisions.</p>

<p>Given the multiple uncertainties affecting global stock markets, William Mason advises investors to focus on traditional safe-haven assets. These assets typically perform more steadily during market turbulence and include gold, government bonds, and certain utility stocks. Although their growth potential may not match high-risk assets, they play a crucial role in protecting portfolios from severe fluctuations.</p>

<p>Additionally, William Mason suggests investors keep an eye on the currency market. In times of geopolitical tensions, certain currencies like the US dollar are often seen as safe assets, which can influence exchange rate trends and indirectly impact the profit performances of multinational companies.</p>

<p>Throughout this analysis, William Mason emphasizes the importance of risk management. He believes that even in seemingly profitable market conditions, investors should not overlook potential risks. Effective risk management strategies such as diversification, setting stop-loss points, and regularly reviewing investment portfolios are key measures to safeguard capital from sudden market changes.</p>
