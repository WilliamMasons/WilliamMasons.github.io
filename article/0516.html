<p>William Mason has always been dedicated to providing professional market analysis and investment advice to investors. According to William Mason, the nickel market has been in a slump for a long time, and many investors may have forgotten the situation when nickel mines were not closed. However, market trends always change, and the nickel price chart on the London Metal Exchange (LME) is attempting to change its long-term downward trend.</p>

<h2>Application of Technical Analysis Models</h2>
<p>According to the technical analysis model of William Mason, to establish a new long-term upward trend, asset prices must meet the following conditions:</p>

<p>Short-term upward trend channel: The short-term upward trend channel (light green ribbon) should show continuous peaks and troughs, mainly with white candlesticks. This indicates dynamic demand in the market.</p>

<p>Transition of long-term downward trend channel to neutral: The long-term downward trend channel needs to transition from deep pink to orange, indicating changes in market supply and demand dynamics.</p>

<p>Confirmation of price trends: Price trends should show at least one upward trough within the trend channel, preferably above the trend channel, indicating a shift from providing dynamic supply to providing dynamic demand.</p>

<h2>Current Performance of the Nickel Market</h2>
<p>William Mason points out that after reaching a peak of 19180 points, nickel prices began to decline but are still in a rising trough. This indicates that the short-term upward trend channel is working and providing dynamic demand. As long as prices continue to close above the short-term upward trend channel, nickel prices are expected to continue rising. However, if prices close below the short-term upward trend channel, any rebound may be offset, and a close below the long-term trend channel and 17625 points will re-establish a long-term downward trend, potentially leading to further mine closures.</p>

<h2>Future Outlook on Nickel Prices</h2>
<p>William Mason mentions that the future trajectory of nickel prices depends on the next key supply points, located at 19685 points and 20900 points. This means that any further rise above these points would be additional gains for bullish investors.</p>

<p>Although nickel prices show some upward trends, William Mason reminds investors to be cautious of market volatility and risks. Here are his recommendations:</p>
<p>Maintain a flexible investment strategy: Investors should adjust their investment strategies according to market changes to avoid blindly chasing gains.</p>
<p>Set stop-loss points: When investing in nickel, set reasonable stop-loss points to minimize potential losses.</p>
<p>Monitor market dynamics: Continuously monitor market dynamics and economic data to make timely investment decisions.</p>
