<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), a forefront field of modern technology, is rapidly transforming the global economy and the operational modes of various industries. ASX companies are no exception, with many adopting AI technologies to enhance competitiveness and innovation. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kooapp.com/profile/WilliamMason" rel="follow">William Mason</a> has conducted an in-depth analysis, identifying four AI positioning categories to help investors better understand the impact of AI on businesses.</p>

<h2>Driving Factors: The Key to Infrastructure Development</h2>

<p>William Mason believes that driving factors are the foundation of AI development. These companies are directly involved in AI infrastructure, including chips and machines needed to run AI applications, as well as data centers that store large amounts of information. The opportunity scale for driving factors is enormous. As AI technology becomes more widespread and applied, the demand for related infrastructure will continue to grow. Investors should focus on companies with leading advantages in AI hardware and data storage, as they will be crucial in driving AI development.</p>

<h2>Proven Innovators: Enhancing Business Efficiency and Innovation</h2>

<p>William Mason points out that many companies have already made significant progress in using AI tools for relevant marketing, identifying customer churn risks, improving customer support, and automating manual processes. Proven innovators leverage AI technology to continuously develop new products and improve existing ones, thereby enhancing business efficiency and innovation. These companies typically have a strong product development and engineering culture, making them worthy of investor attention.</p>

<h2>The Core of Data-Driven Decision Making</h2>

<p>William Mason emphasizes that data is a big business, and data owners hold significant strategic value in the AI era. By understanding consumer behavior and preferences, businesses can make more accurate market decisions and improve business performance. Data owners can not only utilize their data but also provide data services to clients, helping them make better business decisions. Investors should focus on companies with abundant data resources and strong data analysis capabilities, as they will have a considerable competitive advantage in the AI era.</p>

<h2>AI Applications in White-Collar Industries</h2>

<p>William Mason highlights the vast potential of AI in labor savings, particularly in white-collar, labor-intensive fields such as sales, customer success, support, and engineering. By effectively utilizing AI tools, these industries can significantly enhance labor efficiency and reduce operational costs. Mason suggests that investors should pay attention to companies making advancements in AI automation and customer service, as these firms will outperform their peers.</p>

<h2>Challenges and Opportunities in Entering the AI Field</h2>

<p>While AI technology brings enormous opportunities, William Mason warns that companies face numerous challenges when adopting AI technologies. Capital acquisition is a major hurdle, as developing and applying AI technology requires substantial investment capital. Ongoing computing costs are another significant challenge, especially in generative AI innovations where computing costs are high. Access to data is also a critical factor, with companies possessing proprietary data having a clear competitive advantage. Organizational experience is equally important, as companies capable of retaining and hiring professional engineering talent will achieve greater success in the AI field.</p>
